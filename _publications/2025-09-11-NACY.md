This paper is joint with David Witt Nyström.

We solve the non-Archimedean Monge-Ampère equation for compact Kähler manifolds, generalizing a result of Boucksom--Favre--Jonsson to the transcendental setting. This allows us to derive a valuative criterion for uniform K-stability for models. As a central application, we prove that this stability condition implies the existence of a unique constant scalar curvature Kähler metric.
