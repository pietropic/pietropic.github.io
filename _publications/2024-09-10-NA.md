excerpt: 'In this paper I construct a space of valuations attached to a compact complex manifold, that generalize the Berkovich analytification of a projective variety over \\( \mathbf C \\). As an application I get a sufficient algebraic  condition for the existence of constant scalar curvature Kähler metrics on a given Kähler class on a Kähler manifold.'

Abstract: In this paper we develop an analogue of the Berkovich analytification for non-necessarily algebraic complex spaces. We apply this theory to generalize to arbitrary compact Kähler manifolds a result of Chi Li, proving that a stronger version of K-stability implies the existence of a unique constant scalar curvature Kähler metric.
