I am postdoc at the University of Gothenburg under the supervision of [David Witt Nyström](https://www.gu.se/en/about/find-staff/davidwittnystrom).
I am interested in complex geometry, more precisely on the interaction of Kähler and non-Archimedean geometry.

I completed my PhD and Masters degree at Sorbonne Université (Paris VI) under the supervision of [Sébastien Boucksom](https://sebastien.boucksom.perso.math.cnrs.fr/) and [Tat Dat Tô](https://sites.google.com/site/totatdatmath/home). 

During both Masters and PhD I was supported by the [Fondation Sciences mathématiques de Paris](https://sciencesmaths-paris.fr/).

Where have I been?
------

Recently, in the fall of 2025, I was at the Erdős Center in Budapest for the Simons Semester in Analysis and Geometry on Complex Manifolds, and one year before that I visited SLMath for the semester on Special Geometric Structures and Analysis. 

I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of São Paulo in 2021, where my advisor was [Ivan Struchiner](https://www.ime.usp.br/~ivanstru/index.html), we studied Morse Theory, and it's applications such as the H-Cobordism theorem.

Some other things
------

Recordings of some of my recent talks can be found here. Here is a copy of my current CV.

I used to organize a student run academic group, called [A5 Group](https://www.ime.usp.br/~acinco/en.html). During my undergraduate years I also took three summer courses at IMPA. For some of my other non-mathematical interests, see the fun stuff section.
